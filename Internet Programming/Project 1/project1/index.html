<h2 class="aboutme">About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Matthew Campbell.  I am technically a senior but I only go parttime because I only take two classes per semester.  As of today, I am planning to graduate at the spring of 2022.  I am looking forward to graduation!</p>
<p>Here are two interesting facts about me.  I am originally from <a class = 'growing' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana" target="_blank" id="melink">Bloomington, Indiana</a>.  Something that I like about Bloomington is that it is very hilly
in the area, which makes for good hiking.  Another interesting fact about me is that my ancestors on my mom's side actually came from the <a class = 'growing' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower" target="_blank" id="melink">Mayflower</a>.  I think it is very
cool that my some of my ancestors came across one of the first ships that took immigrants to the present-day United States."
<h2 class="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<p>One of my main hobbies is percussion.  I have played percussion instruments since I was young.  The first musical instrument that I remember playing is an instrument similar to a xylophone.  The family of instruments that I remember playing
are called Orff Instruments.  These instruments can be used if a music teacher uses the <a class='growing' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orff_Schulwerk" target="_blank" id="melink">Orff Schulwerk</a>.  Later on in high school, I played in the front ensemble for my
high school's marching band for four seasons.  Nowadays, I am play the percussion for my church's orchestra.  One of my favorite instruments to play in the orchestra is the trash can lid because it is so unconventional.</p>
<p>Another one of my hobbies is traveling. Like percussion, I started traveling when I was a child.  I have traveled to many different parts of the United States. In fact, the first ocean I have ever saw was the Pacific Ocean.  One of my most notable trips was when I visited Quebec.  
I remember going to a church service and all of the people spoke French.  Another notable trip was when I visited Arizona with my dad.  I learned that the mascot of Yuma High School was the criminals.  Moving on to my photo, I am posing like a saguaro cactus.
<h2 class="education">Education</h2>
<p>The beginning of my college career actually started in Indiana.  I mainly took computer classes because that was the advice that my advisor gave me.  When I moved down to Florida, most of my classes did not transfer, but they
count as extra courses.  In fact, only one class counted toward the graduation, which was a public speaking class.  As a result, I had to start over from scratch basically.  Throughout my college career, I have attended three schools, which 
are Ivy Tech (the school I went to in Indiana), FSCJ, and UNF. </p>
<p>My goal is to get a Bachelor's Degree. So far, I have gotten a high school degree and an associate's degree from FSCJ.  As for certifications, I haven't made up my mind which ones I should aim for, but I'll take a look at it when I graduate. </p>
